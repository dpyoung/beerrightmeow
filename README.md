# beerrightmeow

This project was built in a few hours on a weekend to allow my friends to search for local breweries while on the road. Frequent travelers, they are constantly looking at Maps for suggestions of where to visit and have difficulty picking brewpubs versus microbreweries, so I linked to an open API of breweries and displayed those within a certain radius of the user's device. This utilized location services to get latitude and longitude, AJAX calls, API calls, and has ASCII cat art. What's not to love? That is BEER. RIGHT. MEOW.
